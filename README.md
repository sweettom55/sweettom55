Overview
This project reads a list of cities and their average yearly temperatures in Fahrenheit from a text file, converts those temperatures to Celsius, and writes the results to a new file. It demonstrates file input/output operations, basic arithmetic processing, and clean C++ coding practices. The goal was to automate temperature conversion in a simple, efficient way.

Reflection
What problem was this solving?
The project automated the conversion of temperature data from Fahrenheit to Celsius, ensuring accurate and efficient data processing without manual calculations.

What did I do particularly well?
I implemented clear file handling and made sure the code was easy to read and maintain by using proper in-line comments and logical structure.

Where could I enhance my code?
I could improve error handling, such as adding more detailed messages if file operations fail or validating input data more thoroughly. This would make the program more robust and secure when handling unexpected input.

Which pieces were most challenging?
The biggest challenge was configuring the development environment, particularly dealing with Eclipse and MinGW setup issues. I overcame this by troubleshooting linker settings and understanding how console applications are built in C++. This experience strengthened my problem-solving skills and taught me more about build systems.

Transferable skills:
This project reinforced my understanding of file I/O operations, which is applicable in almost any programming language. It also helped me practice writing clean, maintainable code—an essential skill in both academic and professional settings.

How did I make the program maintainable and adaptable?
I used clear variable names, added in-line comments explaining each part of the process, and structured the code logically. This ensures that I or another developer could easily update or expand the program in the future.
